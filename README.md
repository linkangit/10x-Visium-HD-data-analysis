# 10x Visium HD Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial walks through a complete analysis of **10x Visium HD spatial transcriptomics data**. Think of spatial transcriptomics as creating a molecular map of tissues - it's like having a GPS that shows not just where cells are located, but what genes they're actively using at each spot. This is incredibly powerful for understanding how different parts of organs work together and how diseases affect specific tissue regions.

Imagine you're looking at a brain slice under a microscope. Traditional methods might tell you "there are neurons here" or "this area has a lot of activity." But spatial transcriptomics goes much deeper - it can tell you "this exact spot has neurons expressing genes for dopamine production, while the neighboring area has astrocytes managing the blood-brain barrier." It's like upgrading from a black-and-white photo to a high-definition, multi-layered map with thousands of data points.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to load and wrangle complex spatial genomics datasets
- Quality control techniques that separate real biological signal from technical noise
- Clustering methods to identify distinct cell populations
- Spatial analysis approaches that reveal tissue organization patterns
- Data visualization strategies for communicating your findings
- Cell type annotation using established biological knowledge

## Prerequisites

### Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install scanpy squidpy anndata h5py pandas numpy matplotlib pillow pyarrow leidenalg seaborn scikit-learn
```

Each of these packages plays a specific role in your analysis toolkit. Think of them as different tools in a lab bench - scanpy is your main microscope, squidpy is specialized equipment for spatial work, and pandas helps you organize your lab notebook.

### Understanding the Data Structure
10x Visium HD data comes with several key files that work together like pieces of a puzzle:
- **Gene expression matrix**: The core data showing how much of each gene is detected in each spot
- **Spatial coordinates**: Precise X,Y positions telling you exactly where each measurement was taken
- **Tissue images**: High-quality photos of the actual tissue section you're analyzing
- **Metadata**: Technical details about how the experiment was performed and processed

---

## Step 1: Setup and Data Loading

### 1.1 Import Libraries
```python
import os, re, json
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scanpy as sc          # Single-cell analysis toolkit
import squidpy as sq         # Spatial omics analysis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
```

This is like gathering all your lab equipment before starting an experiment. Each library serves a specific purpose in your analysis pipeline. Scanpy is your workhorse - it's been battle-tested by thousands of researchers and contains the core algorithms for analyzing genomics data. Squidpy is the newer, specialized tool that extends scanpy specifically for spatial data - think of it as a high-tech add-on that understands the importance of location. Pandas and numpy handle the heavy lifting of data manipulation, while matplotlib and PIL take care of creating the beautiful visualizations that will help you interpret your results.

### 1.2 Set Data Paths
```python
RUN_DIR = "Visium_HD_data"         # Your main data folder
BIN = "008"                        # Resolution: '008' = 8 micrometers
BIN_DIR = os.path.join(RUN_DIR, f"binned_outputs/square_{BIN}um")
SPAT_DIR = os.path.join(BIN_DIR, "spatial")
MATRIX_H5 = os.path.join(BIN_DIR, "filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5")
```

Here we're setting up the roadmap to your data. The "binning" concept is crucial to understand - Visium HD can capture data at different resolutions, kind of like zooming in or out on a camera. At 8 micrometers, you're getting a nice balance between detail and coverage. Think of it this way: 2μm resolution gives you incredible detail but smaller field of view (like examining individual tree leaves), while 16μm gives you broader coverage but less fine detail (like seeing the whole forest). The 8μm resolution is often the sweet spot for most analyses, giving you enough detail to see cellular structures while covering enough tissue area to understand broader patterns.

### 1.3 Load Gene Expression Matrix
```python
adata = sc.read_10x_h5(MATRIX_H5)
adata.var_names_make_unique()
print(adata)
```

This step creates what we call an AnnData object - think of it as a super-organized filing cabinet for your genomics data. Unlike a simple spreadsheet, this filing cabinet has multiple compartments: the main drawer (adata.X) holds your gene expression numbers, one side drawer (adata.obs) stores information about each tissue spot, another drawer (adata.var) keeps details about each gene, and additional compartments (adata.obsm, adata.uns) hold specialized information like spatial coordinates and analysis results. The `var_names_make_unique()` function ensures that if any genes have duplicate names (which sometimes happens in genomics databases), each gets a unique identifier - preventing confusion later in your analysis.

---

## Step 2: Adding Spatial Information

### 2.1 Load Spatial Coordinates
```python
pos = pd.read_parquet(os.path.join(SPAT_DIR, "tissue_positions.parquet"))
if "barcode" not in pos.columns:
    pos = pos.rename(columns={pos.columns[0]: "barcode"})
pos = pos.set_index("barcode")
```

Now we're connecting our gene expression data to physical locations on the tissue. Each "barcode" is like a unique address label for a specific spot on your tissue slide. The spatial coordinates tell you exactly where that spot is located, measured in pixels on the high-resolution tissue image. This is what makes spatial transcriptomics so powerful - instead of just knowing "Gene A is highly expressed somewhere in this tissue," you can say "Gene A is highly expressed specifically in the upper-left cortical region, coordinates (1247, 892)."

### 2.2 Handle Barcode Matching
```python
# Align spot names between expression data and coordinates
_base = lambda s: s.to_series().str.replace(r"-\d+$", "", regex=True)
if not pos.index.isin(adata.obs_names).all():
    pos.index = _base(pos.index)
    adata.obs["__base"] = _base(adata.obs_names)
    pos = pos.reindex(adata.obs["__base"])
```

This step handles a common technical quirk in 10x data processing. Sometimes the barcode names in your gene expression file and your spatial coordinates file don't match exactly - one might have suffixes like "-1" while the other doesn't. It's like having two different address formats for the same house (think "123 Main St" vs "123 Main St, Unit 1"). This code standardizes the naming so everything aligns properly. Without this step, you might lose spatial information for some of your spots, which would be like having gene expression data without knowing where it came from on the tissue.

### 2.3 Set Spatial Coordinates
```python
pxr, pxc = "pxl_row_in_fullres", "pxl_col_in_fullres"
adata.obsm["spatial"] = np.c_[pos[pxc].to_numpy(), pos[pxr].to_numpy()]
```

Here we're storing the spatial coordinates in the standard format that all downstream tools expect. The convention is to store coordinates as [X, Y] pairs, where X represents the column position (left-to-right) and Y represents the row position (top-to-bottom) in the tissue image. Think of this like GPS coordinates for each spot on your tissue - every analysis you do from here on out will be able to reference back to these precise locations.

### 2.4 Load Images and Metadata
```python
# Load scale factors for image resizing
with open(os.path.join(SPAT_DIR, "scalefactors_json.json"), "r") as fh:
    scales = json.load(fh)

# Load tissue images
img_hires = np.array(Image.open(os.path.join(SPAT_DIR, "tissue_hires_image.png")))
img_low = np.array(Image.open(os.path.join(SPAT_DIR, "tissue_lowres_image.png")))

# Store everything in the standard format
adata.uns["spatial"] = {
    lib_id: {
        "images": {"hires": img_hires, "lowres": img_low}, 
        "scalefactors": scales, 
        "metadata": {}
    },
    "library_id": [lib_id],
}
```

This step loads the actual photos of your tissue section and organizes them alongside your molecular data. The high-resolution image is like having a detailed microscopy photo that shows cellular structures and tissue architecture, while the low-resolution version loads faster for quick previews and initial exploration. The scale factors are mathematical conversion factors that help translate between different image resolutions and coordinate systems - essential for accurate visualization later. By storing everything together in the standard format, you're ensuring that any visualization you create will properly overlay your gene expression data onto the correct locations on the tissue image.

---

## Step 3: Quality Control (QC)

### 3.1 Identify Gene Categories
```python
adata.var["mt"] = adata.var_names.str.startswith(("mt-", "mt."))      # Mitochondrial genes
adata.var["ribo"] = adata.var_names.str.match(r"^(Rps|Rpl)\d", na=False)  # Ribosomal genes
```

We're tagging specific categories of genes that serve as quality indicators for our data. Mitochondrial genes are like cellular "stress markers" - when cells are dying or damaged during tissue processing, their mitochondria break down and release their contents, leading to artificially high mitochondrial gene expression. Ribosomal genes tell us about protein synthesis activity, but extremely high levels might indicate technical artifacts. These aren't "bad" genes - they're actually very informative - but we need to track them separately to assess data quality.

### 3.2 Calculate QC Metrics
```python
sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(adata, qc_vars=["mt", "ribo"], inplace=True)
```

This function acts like a quality inspector, calculating several important health metrics for each spot in your data. For each spot, it counts how many different genes were detected (molecular diversity), how many total RNA molecules were captured (capture efficiency), and what percentage of those came from mitochondrial or ribosomal genes (stress and activity indicators). These metrics help you distinguish between high-quality spots that captured healthy tissue versus problematic spots that might represent damaged tissue, technical artifacts, or areas where the capture process didn't work well.

### 3.3 Visualize QC Metrics
```python
qc_keys = ["n_genes_by_counts", "total_counts", "pct_counts_mt", "pct_counts_ribo"]
sc.pl.violin(adata, qc_keys, jitter=0.3, multi_panel=True)
```

These violin plots are your data quality dashboard. Each violin shape shows you the distribution of values across all spots in your dataset. A healthy dataset typically shows bell-shaped or uniform distributions for gene counts and total counts, with relatively low mitochondrial percentages (usually under 20%). If you see weird patterns - like two distinct peaks in your total counts (suggesting two different populations or technical batches), or very high mitochondrial percentages (indicating widespread cell death) - these are red flags that might need addressing. The jitter parameter adds a bit of random scatter to the points so you can see individual data points even when many spots have similar values.

---

## Step 4: Filtering and Preprocessing

### 4.1 Adaptive Filtering Strategy
```python
# Use data-driven thresholds instead of fixed cutoffs
low, high = adata.obs['total_counts'].quantile([0.02, 0.99])
min_counts = max(100, int(low))
max_counts = max(int(high), 30000)
```

Instead of using arbitrary cutoffs that might work for one dataset but fail for another, we're letting your actual data guide the filtering decisions. This approach looks at your specific dataset and says "let's remove the bottom 2% of spots (which likely have poor capture efficiency) and the top 1% (which might be technical artifacts or unusual areas)." The safety limits (minimum 100 counts, maximum 30,000) prevent the algorithm from being too aggressive - we don't want to accidentally remove all spots if something unusual happened during sample preparation. This adaptive approach works whether you're analyzing delicate brain tissue that captures fewer molecules per spot or dense liver tissue with very high expression levels.

### 4.2 Apply Filters
```python
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_counts=min_counts)    # Remove low-count spots
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, max_counts=max_counts)    # Remove extreme high-count spots
adata = adata[adata.obs['pct_counts_mt'] < 25].copy()   # Remove high-MT spots
adata = adata[adata.obs['pct_counts_ribo'] < 30].copy() # Remove extreme high-ribo spots
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_counts=10)            # Remove rarely expressed genes
```

Now we're implementing our quality filters systematically. Spots with very low total counts probably didn't capture RNA effectively - maybe the tissue was damaged in that area, or the capture chemistry didn't work properly. Spots with extremely high counts might represent technical artifacts like bubbles or debris that trapped extra RNA. The mitochondrial percentage filter removes spots where cells were likely dying (mitochondria leak their contents when cells are stressed). The ribosomal filter catches spots with unusually high ribosomal activity that might not represent typical cellular states. Finally, we remove genes that are detected in very few spots - these are likely noise or extremely rare transcripts that won't be useful for finding patterns across your tissue.

### 4.3 Recompute QC After Filtering
```python
# Recalculate metrics on filtered data
adata.var["mt"] = adata.var_names.str.startswith(("mt-", "mt."))
adata.var["ribo"] = adata.var_names.str.match(r"^(Rps|Rpl)\d", na=False)
sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(adata, qc_vars=["mt", "ribo"], inplace=True)
```

After filtering, we need to recalculate all our quality metrics because the numbers have changed. Some genes might have been removed, and the percentages need to be recalculated based on the new totals. This step ensures that all downstream analyses are working with accurate, up-to-date information. It's like updating your GPS after taking a detour - you want all your navigation to be based on your current position, not where you started.

---

## Step 5: Normalization and Feature Selection

### 5.1 Normalize Library Sizes
```python
sc.pp.normalize_total(adata, target_sum=1e4)  # Normalize to 10,000 counts per spot
sc.pp.log1p(adata)                           # Log-transform: log(x + 1)
```

This two-step normalization process addresses fundamental technical variations in your data. The first step accounts for the fact that different spots capture different amounts of total RNA - some areas of tissue might be denser or the capture efficiency might vary slightly across the slide. By normalizing everything to 10,000 total counts per spot, we're making expression levels comparable between spots. The log transformation then addresses the mathematical challenge that gene expression follows an exponential distribution - a few genes are expressed at very high levels while most are expressed at moderate levels. Taking the log compresses this range and makes the data more suitable for statistical analysis, while the "+1" prevents taking the log of zero.

### 5.2 Find Highly Variable Genes (HVGs)
```python
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=3000, flavor="seurat_v3")
adata = adata[:, adata.var.highly_variable].copy()
```

Not all genes are equally informative for understanding cellular differences. Some genes are like household utilities - they're expressed at consistent levels in almost all cells because they perform basic maintenance functions. Other genes are like specialized tools - they're turned on and off depending on what specific job the cell needs to do. These highly variable genes are the ones that carry the most information about cellular identity and state. By focusing on the top 3,000 most variable genes, we're essentially filtering out the "housekeeping noise" and concentrating on the genes that actually distinguish different parts of your tissue. This dramatically improves the signal-to-noise ratio for all downstream analyses while also making computations much faster.

---

## Step 6: Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

### 6.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
```python
sc.pp.pca(adata, n_comps=50)
```

Even with only 3,000 genes, we're still dealing with a lot of dimensions - imagine trying to visualize data that exists in 3,000-dimensional space! PCA solves this by finding the 50 most important "directions" of variation in your data. Think of it like this: if you were describing the differences between cars, you might start with the most important features (size, price, fuel efficiency) before getting into details (exact paint color, number of cup holders). PCA does the same thing with gene expression - it finds the major patterns that explain most of the differences between spots, creating a much more manageable 50-dimensional summary that captures the essential information.

### 6.2 Build Neighborhood Graph
```python
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30)
```

This step creates a "friendship network" for your tissue spots based on gene expression similarity. Each spot gets connected to its 15 most similar neighbors in expression space (using the first 30 principal components). It's like creating a social network where connections represent "these spots have very similar gene expression patterns and probably represent similar cellular environments." This network becomes the foundation for both clustering (finding groups of similar spots) and visualization (creating meaningful 2D representations of complex data).

### 6.3 UMAP Visualization
```python
sc.tl.umap(adata)
```

UMAP takes your complex, high-dimensional gene expression data and creates a 2D map that you can actually look at and interpret. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods that might scatter similar points randomly, UMAP tries to preserve both local relationships (keeping similar spots close together) and global structure (maintaining the overall organization of different groups). The result is a plot where spots that cluster together have genuinely similar gene expression profiles, and the distances between different clusters reflect real biological differences.

### 6.4 Leiden Clustering
```python
sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=0.8, key_added="leiden_bin")
adata.obs["cluster"] = adata.obs["leiden_bin"].astype("category")
```

The Leiden algorithm looks at your neighborhood network and finds natural communities - groups of spots that are more connected to each other than to spots in other groups. The resolution parameter is like adjusting the zoom level on a microscope: lower values give you fewer, broader clusters (like identifying "cortex" and "white matter"), while higher values give you more specific, smaller clusters (like distinguishing between different cortical layers). A resolution of 0.8 typically gives a good balance for most tissues, but you might need to adjust it depending on how much detail you want to resolve in your specific sample.

---

## Step 7: Visualization and Spatial Analysis

### 7.1 Basic Visualizations
```python
# UMAP plots showing clusters and QC metrics
sc.pl.umap(adata, color=["cluster", "total_counts", "pct_counts_mt"], wspace=0.4)

# Spatial plot showing clusters on tissue
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color="cluster", library_id=lib_id, spot_size=1.2)
```

These plots give you two complementary views of your data. The UMAP plots show you how different your clusters are in "gene expression space" - clusters that appear close together have similar expression profiles, while distant clusters are quite different. The quality metric overlays help you verify that your clusters aren't just artifacts of technical variation (good clusters should have similar total counts and low mitochondrial percentages within each group). The spatial plot is where the magic happens - it shows you where each cluster actually lives on the tissue. This is where you might see that one cluster forms a distinct anatomical structure, another cluster creates a gradient across the tissue, or certain clusters are always found adjacent to each other.

### 7.2 Spatial Neighborhood Analysis
```python
# Build spatial neighborhood graph
sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, coord_type="generic", n_neighs=8)

# Test for spatial enrichment between clusters
sq.gr.nhood_enrichment(adata, cluster_key="cluster")
sq.pl.nhood_enrichment(adata, cluster_key="cluster")
```

Now we're asking a different kind of question: instead of just looking at gene expression similarity, we're examining physical proximity. The spatial neighborhood graph connects each spot to its nearby neighbors in physical space (regardless of gene expression similarity). The enrichment analysis then asks: "Are certain clusters more likely to be found next to each other than you'd expect by random chance?" This can reveal important biological patterns - for example, immune cells might preferentially locate near blood vessels, or certain neuronal types might organize into specific laminar structures. The heatmap visualization shows these relationships clearly, with warm colors indicating clusters that "like" to be neighbors and cool colors showing clusters that tend to avoid each other.

### 7.3 Co-occurrence Analysis
```python
sq.gr.co_occurrence(adata, cluster_key="cluster")
sq.pl.co_occurrence(adata, cluster_key="cluster", clusters=seed_cluster)
```

Co-occurrence analysis extends the neighborhood concept by looking at broader spatial patterns. Instead of just asking "are these clusters neighbors?", it asks "when we see cluster A in a region, how likely are we to find cluster B somewhere in that same neighborhood?" This can reveal larger-scale tissue organization patterns, like how different cell types organize into functional units or how disease processes create characteristic spatial signatures. The analysis can identify both positive associations (cell types that work together) and negative associations (cell types that exclude each other or occupy distinct anatomical niches).

---

## Step 8: Cell Type Annotation

### 8.1 Define Marker Gene Sets
```python
marker_sets = {
    "Excitatory neurons": ["Slc17a7", "Slc30a10", "Tbr1", "Cux1", "Cux2"],
    "Inhibitory neurons": ["Gad1", "Gad2", "Slc6a1", "Pvalb", "Sst", "Vip"],
    "Oligodendrocytes": ["Mbp", "Plp1", "Mog", "Cnp", "Cldn11"],
    "Astrocytes": ["Aqp4", "Gfap", "Aldh1l1", "Slc1a3"],
    "Microglia": ["C1qa", "C1qb", "Cx3cr1", "Tyrobp", "P2ry12"],
    # ... more cell types
}
```

This is where decades of neuroscience research gets translated into computational analysis. Each gene list represents the collective knowledge of researchers who have painstakingly identified which genes are specifically expressed in different cell types. For example, oligodendrocytes (the cells that create myelin sheaths around neurons) reliably express Mbp (myelin basic protein) and Plp1 (proteolipid protein 1) - these aren't just random correlations, they're functionally important genes that define what makes these cells unique. By using these established marker sets, you're connecting your computational clusters to decades of biological knowledge, allowing you to say "this isn't just cluster 3, this is likely a population of astrocytes."

### 8.2 Calculate Module Scores
```python
for name, genes in marker_sets.items():
    present = [g for g in genes if g in adata.var_names]
    if len(present) > 0:
        sc.tl.score_genes(adata, present, score_name=f"score_{name}", use_raw=False)
```

Module scoring is a robust way to assess cell type identity even when individual marker genes might be missing or noisy. Instead of relying on a single gene (which might not be detected in every cell due to technical limitations), it averages the expression of multiple markers for each cell type. This approach is more reliable because it's unlikely that all markers for a given cell type would fail to be detected simultaneously. The scoring also handles the reality that not every marker gene from the literature will be present in your specific dataset - genes might be filtered out during quality control, or they might not be well-captured by the particular capture chemistry used in your experiment.

### 8.3 Assign Cell Type Labels
```python
# Calculate average scores per cluster
score_cols = [c for c in adata.obs.columns if c.startswith("score_")]
avg_scores = adata.obs.groupby("cluster")[score_cols].mean()

# Assign label based on highest scoring cell type
best_class = avg_scores.idxmax(axis=1).str.replace("^score_", "", regex=True)
mapping = {cl: lbl for cl, lbl in zip(best_class.index.astype(str), best_class.values)}
adata.obs["cluster_annot"] = adata.obs["cluster"].astype(str).map(mapping)
```

This step transforms your abstract numerical clusters into biologically meaningful cell type labels. For each cluster, we calculate the average score for each potential cell type, then assign the label corresponding to the highest average score. It's like having a panel of experts vote on what each cluster represents, with each expert (marker gene set) casting their vote based on the evidence they see. The approach is conservative and practical - rather than trying to create complex, multi-label assignments, it gives each cluster the single most likely identity. However, you should always validate these automated assignments by looking at the actual marker gene expression patterns and considering the spatial context.

---

## Step 9: Marker Gene Discovery

### 9.1 Find Differentially Expressed Genes
```python
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, "cluster", method="t-test")
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata, n_genes=10, sharey=False)
```

While the previous step used known markers to interpret your clusters, this step works in reverse - it discovers which genes make each cluster unique, potentially revealing new markers or biological insights. The t-test compares each cluster against all other clusters, asking "what genes are significantly more highly expressed in this cluster than in the rest of the tissue?" This unbiased approach can validate your annotations (if known markers show up as top differentially expressed genes, that's reassuring), identify novel markers for known cell types, or even suggest that some clusters might represent previously uncharacterized cell states or spatial microenvironments.

### 9.2 Create Gene Expression Heatmaps
```python
# Get top marker genes
rg_df = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(adata, group=None)
top_genes = rg_df.groupby("group").head(6)["names"].tolist()

# Visualize as heatmap
sc.pl.heatmap(adata, var_names=top_genes, groupby="cluster", 
              swap_axes=True, vmin=-2, vmax=2, cmap="viridis")
```

The heatmap provides a visual summary of your cluster-defining genes, making it easy to see patterns and validate your clustering results. Each row represents a different gene, each column represents a cluster, and the color intensity shows the relative expression level. Good clustering should produce a heatmap with distinct patterns - each cluster should have its own "signature" of highly expressed genes (bright colors) that are low or absent in other clusters (dark colors). If you see a lot of overlap or unclear patterns, it might suggest that your clustering resolution needs adjustment, or that some clusters might need to be merged or split.

---

## Step 10: Validation and Quality Assessment

### 10.1 Contingency Analysis
```python
# Compare original clusters with annotations
ct = pd.crosstab(adata.obs["cluster"], adata.obs["cluster_annot"])
sns.heatmap(ct, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues")
```

This contingency table acts like a quality report card for your annotation process. Ideally, you'd see a diagonal pattern where most spots from each numerical cluster get assigned to the same biological label. If cluster 0 mostly becomes "Excitatory neurons" and cluster 1 mostly becomes "Astrocytes," that suggests your annotations are clean and reliable. However, if you see that cluster 2 is split evenly between "Oligodendrocytes" and "OPCs," that might indicate either that these cell types are very similar in your dataset, or that your clustering resolution needs adjustment. Mixed annotations aren't necessarily wrong - they might reflect genuine biological transitions or intermediate cell states.

### 10.2 Agreement Metrics
```python
from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score, normalized_mutual_info_score
ari = adjusted_rand_score(adata.obs["cluster"], adata.obs["cluster_annot"])
nmi = normalized_mutual_info_score(adata.obs["cluster"], adata.obs["cluster_annot"])
```

These metrics give you objective, quantitative measures of how well your biological annotations match your computational clusters. The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) measures agreement while correcting for chance - values close to 1 indicate excellent agreement, while values near 0 suggest your annotations are no better than random assignment. The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) captures how much information one labeling provides about the other. These numbers help you compare different annotation strategies objectively and can guide decisions about whether to refine your clustering parameters or marker gene sets.

---

## Step 11: Save Results

```python
OUT = os.path.join(RUN_DIR, f"visium_hd_{BIN}um_processed.h5ad")
adata.write(OUT, compression="gzip")
```

This final step preserves all your hard work in a single, comprehensive file. The h5ad format efficiently stores not just your original gene expression data, but all the analyses you've performed: quality control metrics, cluster assignments, cell type annotations, spatial coordinates, tissue images, and analysis results. The compression saves disk space, and the standardized format means you can easily share your results with collaborators or load them back into Python months later to perform additional analyses. Think of this as creating a complete digital record of your experiment and analysis that can be referenced, shared, and built upon.

## Key Takeaways

### What We Accomplished
Through this workflow, we transformed raw spatial transcriptomics data into biological insights. We started with millions of numbers representing gene expression across thousands of tissue spots, and ended with a annotated map showing where different cell types are located and how they organize spatially. We identified distinct cellular populations, validated them using established biological knowledge, discovered their spatial relationships, and created visualizations that clearly communicate the tissue's molecular architecture.

### Best Practices
The most important lesson is that good computational biology requires constant validation and biological thinking. Always visualize your quality control metrics before making filtering decisions - your data might behave differently than published examples. Use adaptive thresholds that respond to your specific dataset rather than blindly applying cookbook parameters. Validate your annotations through multiple approaches - automated scoring, manual inspection of marker genes, and spatial context should all tell a consistent story. Remember that the computational analysis reveals patterns, but understanding their biological significance requires domain expertise about the tissue and processes you're studying.

### Next Steps
This analysis provides a foundation for more advanced explorations. You might investigate developmental trajectories by ordering cells along differentiation paths, identify spatial domains that represent functionally distinct tissue regions, analyze cell-cell communication by examining ligand-receptor expression patterns between neighboring clusters, or integrate your data with other spatial or single-cell datasets to build more comprehensive tissue atlases. Each of these approaches builds on the quality-controlled, annotated dataset you've created here.
